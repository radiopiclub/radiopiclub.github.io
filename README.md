We will officially stop the domain radiopi.club on June 16, 2024, and host this project on GitHub.

Thank you for your participation over the past four years. Remember that it was first year of COVID19, Three software engineers, stayed at home, made this Raspberry Pi system image, for amateur radio,  our common hobby.

Today, it's been four years since we last updated this project. One reason is due to the fluctuating prices of Raspberry Pi hardware, and another is the developing of Pi OS, with its 32-bit and 64-bit branches, causing some trouble with updates to the Raspberry Pi's general libraries. Raspberry Pi hardware has also step away from its original intention of low-power and low-maintenance.

Of course, the most important reason is that we are too lazy. The hobbies and interests of us have also little changes because of family, work, and life. We are still good friends. So we all thought we should continue not to update this project, keep eyes on the Raspberry Pi, and keep our interest in the original intention. Hopefully, one day the new Raspberry Pi will give us new inspiration.
 
You are still welcome to communicate with us on Github!

我们将于2024年6月16日正式放弃radiopi.club域名，把网站托管在Github上。

感谢您四年来的参与。还记得那是COVID19的第一年，三个闲在家里的软件工程师，因为共同的爱好，给业余无线电做了一个树莓派的系统镜像。

今天，我们已经四年没有更新这个项目了。一部分原因是树莓派硬件的价格波动，另一部分是Pi OS的发展进程，他的32位和64位分支，给树莓派的通用软件库的更新带来了一点困扰。树莓派硬件也正在偏离它当初低功耗、低维护的初衷。

当然更重要的原因，还是我们太懒了。我们三个人的共同爱好和兴趣，也因为家庭、工作、生活发生了细微的变化。我们三个人仍然是好朋友。于是我们一直认为，继续不更新这个计划，对树莓派世界保持观察，对自己的兴趣保持初心。希望有一天树莓派的发展能给我们带来新的灵感。

依旧欢迎你在Github上与我们保持沟通！
